# worlds most annoying button
 Simple game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The aim was to learn more about Event Listeners and the DOM

When the player clicks Start Game, a 15 second timer starts. The player must successfully click the button before the timer runs out. 
The catch is that button moves every time the user mouses over it, hence the name the worlds most annoying button!
